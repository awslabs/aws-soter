## To be done.

These are things that need to be done.

- Rename race1 and race2 to race1 async race2 async.
- Modify external test accordingly.
- Ensure that we spin at the end of race1/race2 because we can't drop().
- Need to make a synchronous version of the client.
- Create a race1 and race2 that are not async.
- Don't keep recreating the client.
